# Microcontrolled Light Bulb Dimmer

A [*light bulb dimmer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimmer) project created using a __PIC microcontroller__ programmed in C (ANSI) language. It was one of the  requirements on the microcontrollers discipline of my [university](https://spo.ifsp.edu.br/).


#### What does it do? ####
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimmer">dimmer</a> is a device able to control the amount of power on a device, it's a way to control loads. We created some funcionalities for the project suck as:</p>

1. Luminosity Control
0. Fade effect
0. Flash
0. Timer mode
0. Darkness detection function

<p>To make it simple for people to use (because we believe that things made from people to people should be like that) we created a Humam Machine Interface (HMI) with simple buttons and an LCD Display (16x2). Since interface bugs are quite hard to debug, if you find any, feel fre to notify me!<p>
  
#### Is there any user manual available? ####

<p>A user manual will soon be released on this readme file.</p>

##### How does it work? ####
<p>You may have heard that when you plug your devices on a power plug they are powered with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current" target="_blank">alternating current</a> (aka AC). We can control the brightness by changing the amount of power been dissipated over the load (in this context a bulb). Making a linear control can be quite dificult since our input signal (sine wave) is not something close to linear, but it can be done.</p>

#### How is it done? ####
<p>Keeping simple: by creating a circuit to detect the zero of the sine wave we can measure time and then trigger a switch with a pwm to allow AC voltage to get to the bulb.</p>

#### Can I just copy/paste your code? ####

<p>This code is open-source, but you should pay attention to some things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In Brazil we use 60Hz, but it is a fact that some countries work with 50Hz AC frequency, which means you might need to change some equations used on the code.</li>
  <li>Another point is the hardware. Since this project is an embadded system it is very hardware dependent - like for example the crystal frequency used to generate the clock for the PIC microcontroller</li>
